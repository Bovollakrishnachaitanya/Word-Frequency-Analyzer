# Word Frequency Analyzer

## Overview

**Word Frequency Analyzer** is a web application that allows users to analyze the frequency of words in the content of any webpage by simply entering a URL. The app uses **React.js** for the front-end and **Flask** for the back-end. It fetches the webpage's text data, processes the word frequencies, and displays the top 10 most frequent words in a clean, user-friendly table format.

## Features

- **User-friendly interface**: Simple form to enter a URL.
- **Fetches and processes web content**: Extracts text content from the URL and analyzes word frequency.
- **Top 10 words**: Displays the most frequent words in the content with their counts.
- **Real-time analysis**: Submit a URL and see the results instantly.
- **Responsive design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup
- **API Communication**: Axios for making HTTP requests
- **Styling**: CSS (Custom styles)

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (for front-end development)
- **Python 3.x** (for back-end development)
- **pip** (for installing Python packages)

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the **frontend** directory.
2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React app at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the **backend** directory.
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS/Linux:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This will start the backend server at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser (the React app should be running at `http://localhost:3000`).
2. Enter a URL of any webpage in the input field and click **Get Word Frequency**.
3. The app will display a table with the top 10 most frequent words from the webpage's content, along with their respective counts.
